Preprocessing
-------------

This example will guide you throught the post-processing of an experimental BCDI dataset
measured at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, beamline ID01. Postprocessing
occurs after phase retrieval, and typically include the following steps: phase rampe
removal, refraction correction, interpolation of the object from the detector frame to
an orthonormal frame etc...
